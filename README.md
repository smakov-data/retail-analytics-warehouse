# Enterprise Retail Analytics Data Warehouse

**Snowflake + dbt + GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**

## 1. Business Scenario

A UK-based online retailer generates transactional sales data from its e-commerce platform.

The raw data contains:

* cancellations and returns
* duplicate order lines
* inconsistent structures
* limited analytical usability

Business teams require trusted datasets to support:

* revenue reporting
* customer analytics
* product performance analysis
* operational decision-making

The objective is to transform raw transactional data into a structured analytics warehouse using Snowflake and dbt, providing reliable datasets for reporting and business intelligence.

Dataset used:

**Online Retail II (UCI Machine Learning Repository)**

~1M e-commerce transactions from a UK-based online retailer.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The solution follows a modern dbt layered architecture.

### Staging Layer

Stores cleaned and standardized source data.

Responsibilities include:

* column normalization
* data type standardization
* basic data validation
* source column renaming

Model:

* `stg_sales`

### Core Analytical Layer

Implements the central analytical model using fact and dimension tables.

Tables:

* `fct_order_lines`
* `fct_orders`
* `dim_customer`
* `dim_product`
* `dim_date`

The core layer implements a dimensional model with shared dimensions, an atomic transaction-level fact table, and a derived invoice-level fact table.
This layer standardizes business entities and prepares data for analytical use.

### Data Mart Layer

Domain-specific analytical datasets for business teams.

Domains:

* finance
* marketing
* product

Tables:

* `mart_revenue_daily`
* `mart_customer_metrics`
* `mart_product_performance`

These datasets are optimized for BI reporting and analytical queries.

## 3. Data Flow

Source dataset contains:

* Invoice
* StockCode
* Description
* Quantity
* InvoiceDate
* UnitPrice
* CustomerID
* Country

Pipeline Flow:

The pipeline transforms raw transactional records into structured analytical datasets ready for reporting and business analysis.

## 4. Analytics Warehouse Data Model

The core model follows dimensional modeling principles with an atomic fact table, shared dimensions, and derived fact tables used for invoice-level analytics.

Fact tables store business events and measures.

Dimension tables provide business context used for filtering, grouping, and aggregation.

### Data Model Diagram

![Analytics Warehouse Data Model](docs/analytics_warehouse_data_model.png)


### Fact Table — `fct_order_lines`

**Grain:** One row per cleaned invoice line after duplicate sequencing.

Contains:

- quantity
- unit price
- sales amount
- cancellation indicator

References shared dimensions through:
- `customer_key`
- `date_key`
- `stock_code`

### Fact Table — `fct_orders`

`fct_orders` is a derived invoice-level fact table built from `fct_order_lines`.

**Grain:** One row per invoice.

Contains:

- gross items
- returned items
- net items
- gross revenue
- cancelled revenue
- net revenue

References shared dimensions through:
- `customer_key`
- `date_key`

### Dimension Tables

* dim_customer
* dim_product
* dim_date

Dimension design:

- `dim_customer` uses `customer_key` as the warehouse surrogate key and retains `customer_id` as the source business key.
- `dim_date` uses `date_key` (YYYYMMDD) as the analytical date key and retains `order_date` as the calendar date.
- `dim_product` uses `stock_code` as the product business key.

These dimensions support analysis across:

- customers
- products
- time

## 5. Analytical Data Marts

### Finance Mart — `mart_revenue_daily`

Daily financial metrics:

- gross revenue
- net revenue
- cancelled revenue

Used for:

- financial reporting
- revenue trend analysis

Primary analytical key:

- date_key

### Marketing Mart — `mart_customer_metrics`

Customer-level metrics:

- number of orders
- total revenue
- first purchase date
- last purchase date

Used for:

- customer analytics
- customer value analysis
- retention analysis

Primary analytical key:

- customer_key

### Product Mart — `mart_product_performance`

Product-level performance metrics:

- units sold
- order counts
- revenue share
- return rate
- cumulative revenue share

Used for:

- product performance analysis
- assortment optimization

---

## 6. Data Quality Controls

Data quality is implemented using dbt tests.

Controls include:

- not null validation
- uniqueness validation
- referential integrity validation
- relationship testing between fact and dimension tables

Examples:

- `not_null`
- `unique`
- `relationships`

Relationship tests validate:

- fct_order_lines.date_key → dim_date.date_key
- fct_order_lines.customer_key → dim_customer.customer_key
- fct_orders.date_key → dim_date.date_key
- fct_orders.customer_key → dim_customer.customer_key
- mart-level references to shared dimensions

These controls ensure consistency and integrity across the analytical model.

## 7. CI/CD Automation

The project uses GitHub Actions to automate validation and deployment workflows.

Pipeline definitions:

- `.github/workflows/dbt-ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/dbt-cd.yml`

### Continuous Integration (CI)

CI validates project changes before deployment.

Typical validation steps:

- checkout repository
- setup Python
- install dbt-snowflake
- install dependencies
- dbt parsing and validation
- dbt test execution

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

CD runs automatically on push to the main branch.

Pipeline steps:

- checkout repository
- install dbt
- dbt deps
- dbt debug
- dbt build

This process automatically deploys the latest analytical models into Snowflake.

## 8. Snowflake Infrastructure Setup

The repository includes infrastructure setup scripts.

```text
infra/
└── init_snowflake.sql
```

The script creates:

- warehouse
- database
- schema
- roles
- permissions

Example components:

- `DBT_WH`
- `ANALYTICS`
- `RAW`
- `MART`

This makes the environment reproducible and easy to deploy.
